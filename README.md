#Weather app

    Simple weather app project

    I think it's finished for now. I want to focus on some other projects, maybe I will update the weather icon with some SVG animation when I'm in the mood.

#Technologies used

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    OpenWeather API

#Things I learned

    First time I used the async / wait syntax
    Learned new things about working with APIs
