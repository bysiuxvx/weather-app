# Weather app

Simple weather app project

I think it's finished for now. I want to focus on some other projects,
maybe I will update the weather icon with some SVG animation when I'm in the mood.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeather API

## Things I learned

First time I used the async / wait syntax
Learned new things about working with APIs
